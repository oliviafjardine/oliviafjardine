## 📌 About Me

I'm a sophomore at UW passionate about the intersection of **mathematics, algorithms, and software engineering**. I thrive on turning complex ideas into usable tools—whether it’s tracking hazardous waste for local governments or building AI-powered systems that detect real-world behavior.

Over the past year, I’ve developed:
- 🔐 A secure compliance web app for **King County, WA**
- 🧠 A computer vision project for **AI-powered shoplifting detection**
- 🧰 Interactive tools to help **CS students learn better and faster**

I enjoy working on meaningful, technically challenging projects—especially ones that push the boundaries of tech for social good.

> If you’re building something impactful, I’d love to collaborate. Let’s talk!
