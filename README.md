## Student in Discrete Math & Algorithms

Nice to meet you! I’m a sophomore studying Discrete Math & Algorithms at UW. I’m passionate about applying math, programming, and AI to solve real-world problems—from hazardous waste tracking to behavior detection. I love hackathons, late-night coding sprints, and building tools that empower others to learn and grow.

Over the past year, I’ve built a secure compliance web app for King County, an AI-powered shoplifting detection system, and interactive CS learning tools. I’m always down to collaborate, especially on meaningful projects that push the limits of tech for good. Let’s connect if you're building something cool 🚀
